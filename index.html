    <h3>What would I like to become?</h3>
    <p>Right from college days I was always amazed about the magic which HTML and CSS can do to bring ideas to life and so I learnt them with passion and interest and always wanted to seek a career in web designing. But when I started my career after college things interestinly I landed up in a customer facing role and I never realised it would be so damn interesting because it was a world of its own. Learnt a lot by talking to people all over the globe and also learnt the art of customer handling. Now after almost a year I'm looking forward to work in a great organization in either a customer facing role or designing and would like to grow my career.</p>
